# Delete by query

## Deleting documents that match a given query

```
POST /products/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": { }
  }
}
```

## Ignoring (counting) version conflicts

The `conflicts` key may be added as a query parameter instead, i.e. `?conflicts=proceed`.

```
POST /products/_delete_by_query
{
  "conflicts": "proceed",
  "query": {
    "match_all": { }
  }
}
```
